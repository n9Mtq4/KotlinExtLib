 * Note that, since extensions do not actually insert members into classes,
 * thereâ€™s no efficient way for an extension property to have a backing field.
 * This is why initializers are not allowed for extension properties.
 * Their behavior can only be defined by explicitly providing getters/setters.
 * "

 * 
 * Ha ha ha. Computers are fast enough. Lets forget about
 * efficiency for a minute and give ourselves the ability to make
 * extension variables because of their usefulness.
 * 
 * Now please note that the efficiency of this is not at all good.
 * It has to look up the instance of the object in a [HashMap].
 * It also adds an [Int] to the [HashMap]. This int is **never**
 * removed and therefor causes a memory leak. Since ints aren't that
 * large in memory it should not be a huge problem as long as this
 * you are not using extension variables in loop.
 * 
 * Here is some example code:
 * ```kotlin
 * class Person(val name: String)
 * val personAgeEV = ExtensionVariable<Int>() // define delegate separately for free fun later
 * var Person.age: Int by personAgeEV
 * 
 * val personInstance = Person("Name")
 * personInstance.age = 21
 * println(personInstance.age) // prints "21"
 * 
 * personAgeEV.free(personInstance) // good idea to do this
 * ```
 * 
 * **INITIALIZED VALUE WARNINGS:**
 * If you are using the default initialized value, give it a non-null
 * value. If a null value is passed in, the result will be the same as
 * if no initialized value is passed at all. For example:
 * ```koltin
 * var Person.mother: Person by ExtensionVariable(null)
 * val personInstance = Person("Name")
 * println(personInstance.mother) // throws UninitializedPropertyAccessException instead of NPE
 * ```
 * 
 * 
 * @param initializedValue the value the variable should be initialized to. **See warnings above.**
 * @param T the return type of the variable
